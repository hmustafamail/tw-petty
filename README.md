# tw-petty
A script that automatically unfollows everyone who does not follow you back on Twitter, the platform for pettiness.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3
- [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/)

## Author's notes
I initially intended to write this as an example for [Python-Twitter](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter), since they need examples, but I had trouble understanding that project's documentation--upon returning to their documentation, I realize that nearly all the documentation needed for usage is under the Modules section. Their [tutorial for getting API keys from Twitter](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) is excellent, though.
